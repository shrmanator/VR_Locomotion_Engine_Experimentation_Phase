This repository contains implementations of various VR Locomotion ideas. 

Note: All implementations are in their early developmental phases. 
      Once a convincing locomotion method is built and approved, 
      in depth development will commence.

Locomotion concept(s) currently under experimentation
  - Jogging/Walking in place [VRCharacter_Trudge.h + VRCharacter_Trudge.cpp]
